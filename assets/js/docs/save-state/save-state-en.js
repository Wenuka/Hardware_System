    This action will save the current state of the template to a local <ib-span class="ib_code">.txt</ib-span> file. The data from this file can be used to pre-populate the template fields in the future. This comes handy when you want to save the invoice details such as company address, logo, client info, currency, notes, etc. so you don't need to re-enter them every time.
